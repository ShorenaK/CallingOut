# Object Oriented Design Principles - CS5004 class of 2024. Final Project!

## Description:
This project is very dear to me. For a long time, I have wanted to create the CallingOut application a social media platform where people can express their frustrations and improve relationships by addressing issues openly before they escalate. The application is designed to help users "call out" friends, family, partners, and others, aiming to reduce resentment, and maintain healthy and smooth relationships. This approach promotes honesty and clarity, helping users address issues head on, let go of grudges, and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. The ultimate goal is to help users gain closure, save time otherwise spent dwelling on unresolved feelings, and prevent relationships from deteriorating. Additionally, the application highlights how much time and emotional energy can be saved by discussing issues early, by being transparent and honest, users can either resolve their differences or end relationships amicably rather than go through discomfort caused by hidden feelings. CallingOut is not just about "calling someone out," but also about creating a space for meaningful discussions before situations spiral out of control. Some might ask, "Why not just pick up the phone and call the person?" The reality is that we often don’t. Many of us hesitate for various reasons perhaps we’re vulnerable or fear the response, or maybe the person isn’t ready to hear what we have to say. If the user is not ready for a conversation after receiving a message via the CallingOut application, the recipient can choose to read it or listen to a voice message when they are ready. Some people dislike confrontation, while others prefer to live with assumptions rather than address uncomfortable truths. We find countless reasons to avoid difficult conversations, even with those that we love. We’re afraid of losing them, or we simply play along, pretending everything is fine. But the question remains: how long can we keep playing along? "CallingOut" application may not solve every day problem, but it offers a platform for expression, at the very least, it might help someone start a conversation that could lead to better understanding, closure, or even a stronger bond.



## Myya please read this one as well --- > Another APPP Idea 
The app focuses on creating companionship not dating, not traditional friendship, but a unique type of supportive relationship. It's designed for people to text and motivate each other, helping them avoid loneliness and offering mutual emotional support.

This is for individuals who may not be ready for a serious relationship, such as those living far apart, recently divorced, widower etc.. or simply not looking for something serious. Instead, the goal is to have meaningful connections that provide encouragement and moral support.

Proposed Integration into the CallingOut App
User Profiles Focused on Companionship:

Allow users to create profiles that emphasize their goals for connection, such as:
"Looking for someone to share daily thoughts."
"Seeking a motivational buddy."
"Wanting companionship to avoid loneliness."
Pairing/Matching System:

Implement a Companionship Matching Algorithm that connects users based on:
Similar emotional needs (e.g., motivation, moral support).
Preferences like communication frequency and topics of interest.
Daily Motivation and Support Features:

Daily Check-ins: Enable users to send automated or personalized motivational messages.
Virtual Encouragement: Add features like shared goals (e.g., fitness, self-care) that users can track and support each other with.
Support Chat Room:

Introduce a dedicated messaging system for one-on-one companionship where users can:
Share updates about their day.
Seek and provide emotional support.
Anonymous Mode for Privacy:

Allow users to connect anonymously if they are hesitant about sharing personal details upfront. This can encourage those going through difficult times to participate.
Mood Tracking and Insights:

Add an optional mood tracker where users can log how they feel. Insights could be shared with their companion to foster understanding and better support.
Gamified Encouragement:

Incorporate rewards for consistent communication and support, such as earning badges or unlocking new themes for the app.
How It Fits the Current Concept
Since the CallingOut app already emphasizes communication and support, adding a companionship feature aligns well with its goal of creating meaningful connections. It can appeal to users who want to avoid loneliness without committing to a formal friendship or romantic relationship.

## This part is for CallingOut app "Future Improvements":

1. To implement Group CallOuts: Add functionality to allow users to create group chats by tagging the appropriate people.
    - Use Case: Users can create groups, such as "Family Members," to collaboratively resolve issues or discuss matters privately.

2. Functionality: Users can toggle a CallOut to "public" mode. Other users can view, react, and reply to public CallOuts. Implement a system to filter or moderate public discussions for quality and relevance.
    - Use Case: When users feel the need for outside perspectives, they can make their CallOut public and receive feedback or advice from the broader community.

3. Enhanced Notifications: Expand the notification system to include:
    - Push notifications.
    - Scheduled reminders for unresolved CallOuts.

4. Improved UI/UX: Transition from a console-based application to a graphical interface for a better user experience:
    - Visualize CallOuts, replies, and reactions hierarchically.
    - Allow drag-and-drop user tagging for group creation.

5. Voice Mail Functionality: Enable users to leave voicemails as part of their CallOuts.            
    - Recipients can listen to these messages at their convenience, promoting thoughtful communication when direct conversations aren't possible.
    - Use Case: Allow users to convey tone and emotions more effectively compared to text, especially when dealing with sensitive topics.

6. Analytics and Insights:
Provide users with insights about their communication patterns:
    - Number of resolved CallOuts.
    - Common reaction types.
    - Response times for group and individual discussions.
